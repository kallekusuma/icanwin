Has such great beauty taken a diversion and somehow reached this earth?

Lekunte Chekki Untara Acchu Neela Shilpa Sampada
Or could they have chiseled it? A great sculpture into your form?
Jagattu Choodani Mahatthu Needhele
You are a magnificence that world has not seen.

Nee Navvu Take Tarinche Tapassila
My waiting is blessed touched by your laughter

Nisheedhulanni Thalonche Thusharaniva
Are you the mist that nights bow out to?

Visukkune Velade Chandamamaye Nuvvunte Na Panentane
An annoyed moon left at once asking why him when you are around.

Ee Nelake Digenu Koti Tharale Ni Kanta Vennelentade
A billion stars descended on Earth to discover what provided you with such soft light.

Chilake Koka Katti Ninne Chuttumutti Seethakokalayena
Did a parrot dress in a sari surround you and turn into butterflies?

Ville Ekkupetti Mello Thali Katti Marala Ramudavvana
Shall I stretch my bow, tie the knot with you and become Rama again?

Andham Nee Inta Chesthondha Oodigame
Is beauty a slave at your abode?

Yuddham Chatindhi Nee Paina Ee Jagame
A war is declared against you by the world

Dasohamandhi Na Prapanchame Adhantha Nee Dhaye
My world surrenders and itâ€™s thanks to you

Visukkune Velade Chandamamaye Nuvvunte Na Panentane
An annoyed moon left at once asking why him when you are around.

Ee Nelake Digenu Koti Tharale Ni Kanta Vennelentade
A billion stars descended on earth to find what gave you such soft light.
