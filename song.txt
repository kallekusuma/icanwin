Inthandham Dhaari Mallindha Bhoomi Paike Cherukunnadha
Has such great beauty taken a diversion and somehow reached this earth?

Lekunte Chekki Untara Acchu Neela Shilpa Sampada
Or could they have chiseled it? A great sculpture into your form?
Jagattu Choodani Mahatthu Needhele
You are a magnificence that world has not seen.

Nee Navvu Take Tarinche Tapassila
My waiting is blessed touched by your laughter

Nisheedhulanni Thalonche Thusharaniva
Are you the mist that nights bow out to?

Visukkune Velade Chandamamaye Nuvvunte Na Panentane
An annoyed moon left at once asking why him when you are around.

Ee Nelake Digenu Koti Tharale Ni Kanta Vennelentade
